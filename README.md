This tool visualizes change points in collections of texts over time. It is an prototype implementation of an approach described in the following research paper:

**Visually Analyzing Topic Change Points in Temporal Text Collections**. Cedric Krause, Jonas Rieger, Jonathan Flossdorf, Carsten Jentsch, and Fabian Beck. *Vision, Modeling, and Visualization 2023*.

### Vue 3 + Typescript + Vite

The implementation is based on a template for using Vue 3 and Typescript in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.
